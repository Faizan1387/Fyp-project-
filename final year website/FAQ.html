    1. WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO SOLVE AIR POLLUTION?
    <svg class="control-icon control-icon-expand" width="24" height="24" role="presentation"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#expand-more" /></svg>

  </summary>
  <p>Air pollution is all around us. Most people in the world live in areas with high levels of air pollution. It harms human health and wellbeing, reduces quality of life, and can negatively impact the economy and ecosystems. These impacts also disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people and communities.</p>
  <p>Air pollution is the largest environmental risk to public health globally. People everywhere are exposed to air pollution, in the workplace, during travel and in their homes. Exposure to household and ambient (outdoor) fine particulate matter air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths each year , according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and is responsible for a substantial amount of disability for those living with diseases caused by air pollution.</p>
  <p>While complex and requiring a coordinated government response, air pollution is a solvable problem. Air pollution is also a transboundary issue meaning that pollution does not stop at administrative or country boarders, which calls for countries and communities to cooperate to address the problem.</p>
  <p>In many developing countries, reliance on wood and other solid fuels, like coal for cooking and heating, and the use of kerosene for lighting, increases air pollution in homes, harming the health of those exposed. It is estimated that more than 2.4 billion people rely on these types of fuels. Most of the effects are felt in parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where burning biomass for cooking is especially prevalent.</p>
   <p>While the impacts on human health are the most pressing, air pollution also significantly impacts several different types of ecosystems and it reduces crop yields and the health of forests. It also reduces atmospheric visibility and increases corrosion of materials, buildings, monuments and cultural heritage sites, and causes acidification of sensitive lake ecosystems.</p>
   <p>Air pollution also has high economic costs related to human health, lost productivity, reduced crop yields and reduced competitiveness of globally connected cities. For example, a 2021 World Bank study found that the economic cost of just the health impacts of air pollution totalled US$8.1 trillion, equivalent to 6.1 percent of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019.</p>
   <p>Air pollution is strongly linked to climate change, with many greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollutants coming from the same sources. Many air pollutants are both bad for human health and powerful climate forcers, thus impacting people’s lives today and making the future less safe for coming generations. This has given rise to coordinated measures to reduce air pollution and GHGs, such as those addressing Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs). Higher temperatures can also increase the volatilization of some pollutants such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), thereby contribute to additional air pollution.</p>
  <p>Air pollution’s links to development, the economy and the environment means reducing air pollution is tied to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , and directly affects the achievement of SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing , SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy , SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities , and SDG 13: Climate Change . It indirectly impacts the achievement of many other SDGs .</p>
   <p>Air pollution has also been implicated in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Studies carried out during the pandemic showed direct links between levels of air pollution and increased vulnerability to succumbing to the disease. Studies also argued that the spread of COVID-19 might be aided by particulate air pollution. These studies need further investigation but are yet another reason for action on air pollution.</p>

    2. WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION?
    <svg class="control-icon control-icon-expand" width="24" height="24" role="presentation"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#expand-more" /></svg>

  </summary>
  <p>Air pollution is caused by gases and particles emitted to the atmosphere by a variety of human activities, such as the inefficient combustion of fuels, open burning of waste, agriculture, and farming. There are also natural sources contributing to air pollution, many of which are impacted by human activities such as forest fires, soil dust and salt in sea spray.</p>
                     <p>Air pollutants can be emitted directly from a source (i.e. primary pollutants) or can form from chemical reactions in the atmosphere (i.e. secondary pollutants). When concentrations of these substances reach critical levels in the air, they harm humans, animals, plants and ecosystems, reduce visibility and corrode materials, buildings and cultural heritage sites.</p>
                     <p>The main pollutants affecting human health are particulate matter , ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), ammonia (NH 3 ) , volatile organic compounds (VOCs) , and carbon monoxide (CO) . The fine particles that damage human health are known as PM 2.5 (particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres), which can penetrate deep into the lungs and pass into the bloodstream affecting different organs and bodily functions. These particles can either be emitted directly (e.g. black carbon, organic carbon, mineral particles, brake dust and tyre wear) or formed in the atmosphere from several different emitted pollutants (e.g. SO 2 , NO X , NH 3 , and VOCs ).</p>
                      <p>Ozone (O₃), is an important secondary pollutant. It is a potent lung irritant and stunts growth in plants. It is also a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG). O₃ is formed in the troposphere, near the Earth’s surface, when certain precursor pollutants react in the presence of sunlight. The powerful GHG, methane (CH₄), is responsible for a significant portion of O₃ formation. This tropospheric ozone is different from the ozone in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere), which protects us from ultraviolet light from the sun.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a group of air polluting chemical compounds, comprising nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and nitrogen monoxide (NO). NO 2 is the most harmful of these compounds for human health and is generated from human activities. It impacts human health, reduces atmospheric visibility, and can play a significant role in climate change, at high concentrations. Finally, it is a critical precursor to the formation of O₃ and fine particulate.</p>

    3. HOW LONG HAS AIR POLLUTION BEEN A PROBLEM?   
    <svg class="control-icon control-icon-expand" width="24" height="24" role="presentation"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#expand-more" /></svg>

  </summary>
  <p>Air pollution has been associated with humans for millennia, starting with the use of fire for cooking and warmth. Dangerously high levels of outdoor air pollution became a problem during the industrial revolution, where the massive use of coal gave rise to many episodes of serious urban air pollution. Most recently, in June 2023, New York faced an extreme air pollution caused by the wild forest fires in North America ( New York Orange Sky and Burning Eyes).</p>
               <p>The case of the London fog in 1952, is an extreme example, causing a surge in deaths over a one-week episode. The pollution from residential coal fires, coal for electricity generation, the use of dirty fuels for transport, and industrial pollution, interacted with weather phenomena which trapped the pollution over London and led to over 4000 excess deaths over these few days. The public outcry that followed, led to the adoption of the UK Clean Air Act (1956). Other fatal air pollution episodes, e.g. in Donora, USA (1948), and Meuse Valley, Belgium (1930), prompted similar actions to be taken to tackle air pollution in other countries.</p>
               <p>Continued reliance on fossil fuels through the 20th century saw air pollution increase as countries industrialized. In newly industrialised countries like China and India, this has led to extreme air pollution events, like those experienced in the past in the USA and Europe. However, new forms of cleaner and renewable energy, and the adoption of air quality regulations and management processes, are reducing reliance on some polluting fuels and practices.</p>

  </summary>
  <p>The air pollutant of greatest concern for human health, and for which there is the strongest evidence is fine particulate matter. This has a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, also known as PM 2.5 . These fine particles are invisible to the human eye and 40 times smaller than the width of a human hair. They can do a lot of damage to our bodies. These particles are small enough to penetrate deep into our lungs, where they cause inflammation of sensitive lung tissue and can pass into the blood stream, affecting organs like the heart and brain. The WHO estimates that in 2016 exposure to PM 2.5 caused 
    <!---<a href=" https://www.who.int/news/item/25-03-2014-7-million-premature-deaths-annually-linked-to-air-pollution">--->7 million premature deaths annually . .</p>
<p>Air pollution causes both acute disease and chronic disease. There is strong evidence linking long-term exposure to air pollution with an increased risk for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung and upper aerodigestive cancers, adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e. low-birth rate, pre-term births and reduced birth weight (babies born weighing less than five pounds), diabetes and cataracts. The 
<!--<a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/">WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IRCA) , has designated 
<a href="">https://publications.iarc.fr/538</a>air pollution as a carcinogen.</a>-->
</p>
<p>Some immediate health effects of air pollution exposure include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, shortness of breath, cough, and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions, like asthma attacks, and chest pain. Age, pre-existing conditions, other risk factors for disease and sensitivity to the pollutant, can all affect how a person reacts to a pollutant.

</p>
<p>Air pollutant gases can also seriously affect human health. Carbon monoxide (CO), restricts the transfer of oxygen to tissues and can be fatal in very high concentrations. Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), is a potent lung irritant affecting the health of those with pre-existing respiratory disease (asthma and COPD), especially those living and working close to SO 2 sources. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are linked to a range of impacts, spanning from respiratory irritation, to the development of asthma and increased mortality. Exposure to ozone (O 3 ) causes respiratory diseases and was associated with 365,000 premature deaths in 2019, according to

    6. What types of air pollution are there?
    <svg class="control-icon control-icon-expand" width="24" height="24" role="presentation"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#expand-more" /></svg>

  </summary>
  <p>Air pollution consists of gases and/ or particles. These have a distinct chemical or physical structure, or a distinct effect on human health.
  </p>
  <p>The main air contaminants are:</p>
 <h3>- Sulphur dioxide (SO2).</h3><p>This contaminant is mainly emitted during the combustion of sulphur-containing fossil fuels, such as crude oil and coal. Sulphur dioxide concentrations in air have decreased in the past two decades, mainly because we use more non-sulphur-containing fuels for the generation of energy. Sulphur dioxide is a stinging gas and as a result it can cause breathing problems with humans. In moist environments, sulphur dioxide may be transferred to sulphuric acid. This acid causes acidification and winter smog

  </p>
<h3>- Nitrogen oxides (NOx). </h3>
<p>These contaminants are emitted by traffic, combustion installations, such as power plants, and the industries. Nitrogen oxides are also released from farmland in the agricultural sector. Using catalysers in car exhausts can prevent emissions of nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides are gasses that react with other air pollutants when they are present in air. For example, nitrogen oxides play an important rolein the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere, and in acidification and eutrophication processes. They can deeply penetrate the lungs and damage human lung functions.
- Ammonia (NH3). Ammonia forms during agricultural activities. Ammonia plays an important role in acidification and eutrophication.
</p>
<h3>- VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds).</h3>
<p>VOC can be a range of different contaminants, such as carbohydrates, organic compounds and solvents. These compounds usually derive from petrol and gasoline reservoirs, industrial processes and fuel combustion, paint and cleanser use, or agricultural activities. VOC play an important role in ozone shaping in the lower atmospheric layer, the main cause of smog. VOC can cause various health effects, depending on the kind of compounds that are present and their concentrations. Effects can vary from smell nuisance to decreases in lung capacity, and even cancer.

</p>
<h3>- Carbon monoxide (CO). </h3>
<p>This gas consists during incomplete combustion of fuels. When we let a car engine run in a closed room, carbon monoxide concentrations in the air will rise extensively. Carbon monoxide contributes to the greenhouse effect, smog and acidification. The gas can bind to haemoglobin in blood, preventing oxygen transport through the body. This results in oxygen depletion of the heart, brains and blood vessels, eventually causing death.
- Dust particles. Dust particles form a complex of organic compounds and minerals. These can derive from natural sources, such as volcanoes, or human activities, such as industrial combustion processes or traffic. Particles are categorised according to particle size. The smallest particles have the ability to transport toxic compounds into the respiratory tract. Some of these compounds are carcinogenic. The upper respiratory tract stops the larger dust particles. When they are released into the environment, dust particles can cause acidification and winter smog.
</p>
<h3>- Methane (CH4). </h3>
<p>The main source of methane pollution is agriculture. But smaller amounts of methane can also be released during waste combustion and natural gas extraction. Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect and ozone loss.

  p>Under the Resource Management Act 1991, the primary responsibility for managing air quality sits with regional councils (for example Environment Canterbury and Waikato Regional Council) and unitary authorities (for example Auckland Council, Nelson City Council). These entities are also responsible for regulating and issuing consents for discharges of pollutants to air.</p>
<p>The National Environmental Standards for Air Quality (NES) sets minimum air quality standards at the national level. All regional councils and unitary authorities develop a regional policy statement and a regional plan to manage air quality. Some develop a specific plan related to air quality (an ‘air plan’). The standards in regional plans and policy statements must be at least as stringent as the NES.</p>

  <p>Under the Clean Air Act, EPA has the authority to regulate vehicle emissions. Light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) must be certified to meet applicable emissions standards. Regulations are in place to ensure emissions do not increase as a result of changes made to a vehicle or engine, including a conversion. The Clean Air Act prohibits anyone from knowingly removing or rendering inoperative any device or design element installed on a certified vehicle or engine. These actions could be considered tampering, a violation that carries a significant fine.

in 2020, superseding all previous EPA tampering guidance memorandums, to help clarify what qualifies as tampering of emissions monitoring devices to prevent air pollution. The requirements in 40 CFR 85 specify that if a conversion system is compliant with EPA or CARB regulations, the manufacturer is exempt from the tampering prohibition for that particular system. Emissions standards are fuel neutral, which means that the same emissions requirements must be met no matter which fuel or technology powers the engine or vehicle. Conversion systems must meet the same emissions standards that gasoline or diesel products do.
